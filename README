# Full-Stack Pizza Ordering App

This is a small full-stack application that allows users to configure, order, and view pizza orders. The project is built as a monorepo containing a Node.js/Express backend and a React frontend.

## Features

- **Create Pizza Orders**: A user-friendly form to select a pizza size, add ingredients, and place an order.
- **List & Filter Orders**: View all created orders in a table with features for sorting (by date, price) and filtering (by customer name).
- **Search by ID**: A modal-based search to find a specific pizza order by its unique ID.
- **Shared Types**: A dedicated package ensures type safety and consistency between the frontend and backend.
- **Containerized Environment**: The entire application stack can be run easily with a single Docker command.

## Tech Stack

- **Monorepo Management**:
  - **Yarn Workspaces**: To manage dependencies and scripts across multiple packages (`api`, `client`, `types`).

- **Backend (`apps/api`)**:
  - **Runtime**: Node.js
  - **Framework**: Express.js
  - **Language**: TypeScript
  - **Development**: `ts-node-dev` for live reloading.
  - **Dependencies**: `cors`.

- **Frontend (`apps/client`)**:
  - **Framework**: React (bootstrapped with Create React App)
  - **Language**: TypeScript
  - **UI Library**: Ant Design (for components like forms, tables, modals, and notifications).
  - **Styling**: Plain CSS with a modern reset.

- **Shared (`packages/types`)**:
  - A dedicated workspace package for sharing TypeScript interfaces and types between the API and the client.

- **Tooling & Environment**:
  - **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose.
  - **Node Version Manager**: NVM (with a `.nvmrc` file to enforce the Node.js version).
  - **Package Manager**: Yarn v1 (Classic).

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following installed on your machine:

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (Recommended for the easiest setup).
- **Node.js** (v18.18.0 or as specified in the `.nvmrc` file). We recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions.
- **Yarn v1 (Classic)**.

## Getting Started

There are two ways to run this project: using Docker (recommended) or running each service locally.

### Method 1: Running with Docker (Recommended)

This is the simplest way to get the entire application running.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone INSERT THE CORRECT LINK TO CLONE
    cd <project-folder>
    ```

2.  **Build and run the services:**
    This command will build the Docker images for the API and the client and start them.
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```

3.  **Access the application:**
    -   **Frontend (React App)**: Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
    -   **Backend (API)**: The API will be running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Method 2: Running Locally (Manual Setup)

This method is useful if you want to run the services directly on your machine without Docker.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone INSERT THE CORRECT LINK TO CLONE
    cd <project-folder>
    ```

2.  **Set the correct Node.js version:**
    If you have NVM installed, simply run:
    ```bash
    nvm use
    ```
    This will automatically use the version specified in the `.nvmrc` file.

3.  **Install all dependencies:**
    From the root of the project, run the `yarn` command. This will install dependencies for all workspaces (`api`, `client`, and `types`).
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

4.  **Start the Backend API:**
    In a new terminal window, run the following command to start the API server:
    ```bash
    yarn dev:api
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

5.  **Start the Frontend Client:**
    In a second terminal window, run the following command to start the React development server:
    ```bash
    yarn start:client
    ```
    Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`.
