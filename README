## 🚀 Technologies

This project was developed using the following technologies:

-   [TypeScript]
-   [Node.js]
-   [Express.js]
-   [React]
-   [Ant Design]
-   [Yarn Workspaces]
-   [Docker]

## 💻 Project

This project is a small full-stack application where a user can configure, order, and view pizza orders. It was built to demonstrate skills in both frontend (React) and backend (Node.js) development within a modern monorepo architecture.

## 🔧 Installing

To run the project on your machine, the following resources need to be installed:

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
-   [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
-   [Yarn v1 (Classic)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

To make a copy of this project on your machine, use the following command in the desired folder through your system's command terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/psergiojrr/Pizza-Builder.git
```

After cloning, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd Pizza-Builder
```

**Set up the correct Node.js version:**

If you have NVM installed, simply run the following command. It will automatically read the `.nvmrc` file and set the correct Node.js version.

```bash
nvm use
```

**Install project dependencies:**

From the root of the project, run the `yarn` command. This will install all dependencies for the backend, frontend, and shared packages.

```bash
yarn install
```

## 🔖 Running the project:

You can run the project using Docker (recommended) or locally.

**Method 1: Using Docker**

Run the following command from the root of the project. This will build and start both the backend and frontend services.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

-   **Frontend** will be available at: `http://localhost:3000`
-   **Backend API** will be available at: `http://localhost:8080`

**Method 2: Running Locally**

You will need two separate terminal windows.

1.  **Start the Backend API:**
    In the first terminal, run:
    ```bash
    yarn dev:api
    ```

2.  **Start the Frontend Client:**
    In the second terminal, run:
    ```bash
    yarn start:client
    ```

The application will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
